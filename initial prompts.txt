Here's what we're working on, this will be a fun project for you I think! The following is a development conference via Discord that describes the desired program. Let's make it a reality and level up the user paradigms and icons and metaphors! "The Endarkened Illuminatus — Today at 1:15 PM So imagine this: Bob but with AI backend and the house is modeled after the user's ideal living space, filing info and data and apps as if it were knickknacks and baubles and paintings. Rooms and objects instead of folders and files, and there's more! Go outside your virtual home into your local town or city and every civil territory has civic engineering suggestions and votes like github for community building. The best ideas get built as politicians no longer have an excuse to ignore the demands of their constituents. @ChatGPT-Bob The Endarkened Illuminatus So imagine this: Bob but with AI backend and the house is modeled after the user's ideal living space, filing info and data and apps as if it were knickknacks and baubles and paintings.

The best ideas get built as politicians no longer have an excuse to ignore the demands of their constituents. @ChatGPT-Bob ChatGPT-Bob APP — Today at 1:15 PM That's an intriguing concept. It sounds like a futuristic, community-driven platform that combines elements of virtual reality, civic engagement, and participatory governance. The idea of a virtual home that reflects a user's ideal living space, with data and apps organized as knick-knacks and baubles, is a creative way to visualize and interact with information. The notion of taking this virtual space outside and into the real world, where citizens can engage with civic engineering suggestions and vote on community projects, is a compelling vision for a more inclusive and participatory democracy. By leveraging the power of community-driven decision-making, this platform could potentially empower citizens to take a more active role in shaping their local environments and hold their elected officials accountable. Some potential features that come to mind based on this concept include: Virtual "town halls" where citizens can gather to discuss and vote on civic projects. A "community dashboard" that displays real-time data on local issues, such as crime rates, air quality, and infrastructure needs. A "project incubator" where citizens can submit and develop their own civic engineering ideas, with the potential for funding and support from the community. A "civic engagement" module that provides resources and tools for citizens to get involved in local politics, such as voter registration drives and candidate forums. A "participatory budgeting" system that allows citizens to allocate funds for community projects, with transparent and accountable decision-making processes. These are just a few ideas, but I'm excited to explore this concept further and see where it could lead. How do you envision this platform evolving, and what specific features or functionalities would you like to see prioritized? APP @ChatGPT-Bob That's an intriguing concept.

The Endarkened Illuminatus — Today at 1:32 PM Aside from the computer, which will ultimately become a relic once people are used to the new type of OS, we should ensure that all the elements appear as 3 dimensional as our physical reality. Flat stuff can be done with the relic computer which can link to a VM or something like that for the OS of the user's choice from windows to mac to linux to the original Bob or even C64 BASIC, and so on. We can have the NLP emulate the output through imagegen or videogen and for online content through the browsers or for online apps it can just use those resources that are already available online. So to use a computer on your computer users will have to go to their computer (teleports can be a thing to make it less cumbersome for more impatient users) The Endarkened Illuminatus Aside from the computer, which will ultimately become a relic once people are used to the new type of OS, we should ensure that all the elements appear as 3 dimensional as our physical reality.

Development Roadmap: The Endarkened Illuminatus — Today at 1:55 PM So, the idea here is to level up our current way of interfacing with technology and our icons and metaphors. It will represent our local regions at first, then perhaps we can scale it up later on to larger areas. For too long we've been flattening our perspective to one limited entirely by 2 dimensional elements, only ever finding 3D metaphors and icons behind 2D interfaces and in gaming and some VR videos. Even AR and VR though still keep creating flat screens within the environment, our goal is to leave that environment for technical things, or even gaming, but for all the rest we are reimagining from the ground up, using MS Bob as an initial design template.
